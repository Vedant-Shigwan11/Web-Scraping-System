# **Web Scraping System**

### **Purpose of the Code**
This script is designed to **scrape book details** from the website [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/). It extracts information such as **title, price, and link** for each book available on the site. The script supports **pagination**, allowing it to scrape data from multiple pages automatically. Instead of saving the output to a file, the extracted book details are **displayed directly in the terminal** in real time.
